1.Explain Kubernetes cluster architecture?
2.How various components of Kubernetes interact when you run kubectl apply(pod)
3.what is the purpose of services in Kubernetes?
4.Why is hardcoding pod IP communication is a bad practice?
5.what are the types of services in Kubernetes?
6.what are labels and selectors in Kubernetes?
7.what would you recommend NodPort service or Load balancer type service and why
8.How kubernetes services are related to Kube Proxy?
9.what is the disadvantage of load balancer service type?
10.what is a headless service in Kubernetes and when did you use it?
11.can a pod access service in different namespace, if yes, how?
12.Explain how you can restrict access to db pod to only one app in the namespace?
13.Explain the deployment strategy that you follow in your organization?
14.Explain the rollback strategy that you follow in your organization?
15.Design a solution to avoid rollbacks
16.Explain the deployment strategies that you used in the past?
17.Explain the role of CoreDNS in Kubernetes
18.A Devops engineer tainted a node as “Noschedule”. Can you still schedule a pod?
1. Pod is stuck in crashloopbackoff, what steps will you take?
2. What is the difference between liveness and readiness probes?
3. Explain the difference between Ingress and LB service type?
4. Your app works with cluster IP but fails with Ingress, How do you troubleshoot it
5. Why do I need to setup Ingress controller after creating ingress?
6. We have an in-house load balancer, can we use Ingress with our load balancer?
7. Your deployment has replicas:3, but only 1 pod is running. What could be wrong?
8. Your pod mounts a configmap, but changes to the configmap are not reflected?
9. Explain how Node Affinity works and when will you use it?
10. What is the difference between Node Affinity and Node Lable Selector?
11. What is container runtime in Kubernetes?
Q: You deleted a deployment, but the pods are still running. How?
A: The associated ReplicaSet wouldn't have been deleted. If the Deployment was paused or not cleaned up properly, the ReplicaSet would continue maintaining the pods.
Q: A pod with no memory limit defined is still getting OOMKilled. What could be the reason?
A: Without a memory limit, the pod gets BestEffort QoS and can over consume node memory. If the node runs out, the kubelet OOMKills such pods first to reclaim memory.
Q: A HPA is in place, but even under load, replicas remain at 1. What could cause this?
A: The metrics server might not be reporting CPU or memory usage properly. Without metric data, the HPA controller would not initiate any scale out actions.
Q: A Deployment was rolled out, but pods are not created. What should be checked first?
A: The Deployment might have failed admission due to validation or mutation webhooks. Events or kubectl describe would show webhook related errors that blocked pod creation.
Q: You exposed a pod via NodePort, but it's still unreachable externally. What’s likely missing?
A: The node level firewall or cloud NACL might be blocking the assigned port. Even though Kubernetes exposes it, the OS would still drop the traffic if not allowed.
Q: A container image is updated in the registry, but pods are still pulling the old image. Why?
A: The deployment might be using an immutable image digest or relying on the default imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent. In that case, existing nodes would cache the image and avoid pulling the new version.
Q: You use emptyDir for temporary data, but after a pod restart, all the data is gone. Why?
A: That’s expected. emptyDir would be wiped whenever the pod is terminated or rescheduled since it’s tied to the pod lifecycle.
